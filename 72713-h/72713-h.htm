<h2>CHAPTER ONE</h2>

<h3><em>The Sunday School at the Chapel</em></h3>

<p>Already the room had become comparatively
quiet. The bustle of closing Sunday
School as the children were hastening to the
door was succeeded by a surprising stillness.
The teachers were now busy setting the room
in order. Miss Merton was just about to
take down the big picture roll, from which
she had been teaching a juvenile class, when
she heard a piping voice. Turning, she saw
the pale, hump-backed blind boy who had
joined her class some weeks since, with his
cousin Louise, who led him.</p>

<p>“What do you want, Tim?” she asked
kindly.</p>

<p>“Please, ma’am, can I feel o’ that picture
you was telling about?”</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly,” exclaimed Miss Merton,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
touched by the appeal. She directed the thin
little hand.</p>

<p>“It’s a big picture,” he said. “Where’s the
sheep?”</p>

<p>The teacher directed his hand across each
portion of the picture. The lesson had been
about the Good Shepherd, and Tim insisted
on every detail. As the parable was rehearsed
and his hand was directed to the hills, the
flocks, the big sheep in the foreground, the
crook, and the Shepherd, his satisfaction grew.
A sigh of pleasure escaped him. By the time
that the story was done, all the teachers stood
grouped about, for all were touched at the
spectacle of the crippled boy. In the few
weeks that he had attended, Tim had become
greatly interested. A new world had opened
to his blind eye. And yet he had not so far
learned to bow his head at the times of
prayer. For Tim had been taught none of
the actions that accompany Christian ways.
He was a saloon-keeper’s son.</p>

<p>Out on the street corner, the teachers and
several pupils stood waiting for the street
car. For this was an afternoon Sunday School
at the little chapel in the heart of the great
city. North and south along the street rose
the stone fronts of the many houses, red, yellow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
gray, brown, some new and some weather-beaten.
They were interspersed here and there
with a grocery, a delicatessen, a shop, or a
saloon. The side streets were lined with
pretty, cheerful cottages or tall, flat buildings—not
very flat to the eye, for they were
narrow and thin, even four stories high. But
so they were called in the city. The little
crippled figure led by pretty Louise, with her
long curls, her handsome coat and hat, was
trudging along the concrete walls. Now and
then a carriage passed, or an auto whirred
by. At last the proper car came banging to
a stop, and the group of teachers climbed in,
to be carried swiftly to their several destinations.</p>

<p>It was in one of these side streets that Tim
found his home. Alas, he had seldom gone far
from it. He had never shared the active hustling
pleasures of boy life in the great city.
From the front steps one could see in the
distance a bit of open prairie. But Tim
could almost number on his finger the times
he had played on any grass except that in
the backyard. For Mr. Rudiger took great
pride in his home. Its fresh, cheery, yellow
bricks were set off with white. The rear lot
was green and beautiful in summer with well-kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
grass, bushes, and flowers. But many an
hour the neighbors saw the still figure of the
blind boy, seated on the front porch, his only
company his thoughts or the noises of the
town. The fact that he was a saloon-keeper’s
son had added deep and tender pathos to the
lonely figure.</p>

<p>Late that evening Tim lay curled up and
dozing in the big Morris chair. His mother
sat rocking beside him. Louise had gone to
bed. Tim had told over and over again about
the afternoon at the chapel.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Tim,” said his mother, “you’ve
got Sunday School on the brain.”</p>

<p>“Wish I could a took part in that Christmas
program. S’pose I can’t.”</p>

<p>There was a rattle and bark outside the
house. The dogs, Jim and Gyp, set up a howl
in the kennel under the porch. No, it was not
brother Alex. He had been gone since dinner.</p>

<p>The house was again disturbed by the homecoming
of Mr. Rudiger. He always remained
in his place of business very late. He had an
idea, too, that robbers never attack a drunk
man. So that he came home tonight with the
receipts of the day, singing along the alley.
He had just parted from some cronies, and
came up the rear sidewalk with somewhat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
uncertain steps. His big mustache looked bigger
still across his face red with excitement
and with the night air. Tim was stirred up in
the chair. Louise had to get up. The dogs
let people know that they were awake. Even
the parrot blinked and screeched. The house
was all lit, the table set. And long into the
night Louise played and sang, and those of
the family who wanted to feasted at the table.</p>

<p>“Where’s that boy? Alex, I mean?” exclaimed
Mr. Rudiger at last as he looked up
from the Sunday paper he had been reading.
“That boy runs everywhere.”</p>

<p>“Must be at Grandma’s,” answered his wife.</p>

<p>The house was at last quiet, and Tim
tucked away in his bed. But excited, feverish,
he was unable to sleep. At such times Tim
was very quiet in the home. He little enjoyed
these night festivities. Most of the
night was gone before he could sleep, and the
sun was bright and high on the day following
before he was again seen in his place on
the front porch.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER TWO</h2>

<h3><em>The Visit to the Police Court</em></h3>
</div>

<p>Toward school time a group of boys hurrying
by on the way to the school room, caught
sight of Tim in the sunshine on the steps.
One of them called out:</p>

<p>“Hello, Tim! Heard about Alex? He’s
down to the Avenue Station. Got pinched last
night.”</p>

<p>The little lad made no answer, but the
words had reached the ear of his mother, who
was busy setting the house in order, and happened
to be close to the open window. Mrs.
Rudiger had been anxious all morning. Alex
had never before remained away over night
without permission. Her anxiety had grown
steadily, and she was not without foreboding
of ill. With a call to Louise, who had not
yet set out for school, that she should take
care of Tim, she set out for Mr. Rudiger’s
place of business.</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw! Boy’s trick,” was his instant
declaration. But he called up the police station<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
by telephone. No boy of such a name
had been arrested. He was smiling scornfully
as he turned to his wife; but just then
Louise walked in, leading Tim. A message had
come from Uncle Tom. Mr. Rudiger again
called up the station and found that a load
of prisoners, including some boys, had just
gone away to the court. The message might
be correct. Alex may not have given his true
name. As Rudiger set out for the police
court, Tim sat by him on the car. It had
proven impossible to get away from Tim.
Tim loved his brother tenderly, and a very
sober look settled on the generally peaceful
face. There were but few vehicles on the
street at this time, hence the car went so fast
that it soon reached the neighborhood of the
court.</p>

<p>The police court was well filled with a queer
crowd. Several blue-coated men stood about
the sidewalk, the door, and the room. The
dingy, dirty chairs were mostly filled with
people not altogether pleasant to see. Haggard
faces and sour looks were on every
hand.</p>

<p>“Is he here?” was Tim’s whisper, as he
pressed his father’s hand.</p>

<p>It was only too true that Alex was there.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
On a bench lined with prisoners, two ragged,
hard-featured young fellows beside him, sat
Alex, his head bowed in shame. He had not
observed the new arrivals.</p>

<p>Tim could smell the stale tobacco. It did
not need eyes to show him the dirty, overloaded
spittoons. He could not see the high
and dirty walls, the smoky ceiling all littered
with cobwebs, the windows that had known no
other cleaning but the dirty rain in many a
day. The gas burned dimly over the desks
and above, for the day was cloudy. The air
was too bad for the light to burn clearly.
Nor could he see the long, low desk, and the
judge who sat with other court officials about
him.</p>

<p>A case was called which did not at the
moment interest him, but at which his father
drew a quick breath. One of the boys at
Alex’s side was called forward, the charges
read, and testimony taken.</p>

<p>A hold-up! There was reason why Mr.
Rudiger should start. A short examination
revealed that the boy had been several times
in court before. A leer and grin were on his
face as he took his seat. The other of Alex’s
companions was called, and the situation seemed
much the same. He carried a dark and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
rebellious look as if he felt himself outrageously
treated, and would say little.</p>

<p>Tim did not realize that Alex had been
called until he heard his brother’s voice. At
the word, he grasped his father’s hand in
agitation, and slipped down from the seat.
He stood by his father’s knee as Alex gave his
testimony.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the judge, “tell us the truth.”
He spoke kindly, and his look was encouraging,
for he saw the boy was not of the class
represented in the other two.</p>

<p>“We went down to Frost Street about
dark,” said Alex, “near the crossing of the
railroad, and stands there in a shady place.
Soon there comes along a feller, and one of
the boys he steps out and shows the gun,
and the other goes thru his clothes. Then we
starts up a alley by a big factory and cuts
across to Grant Avenue. When we was walkin’
along, Pete sees some fellers across the
street, and he says, ‘Plain clothes,’ joking like.
Mike only laughs. Soon we comes to the
corner of Baldwin Place, where there is an old
yard for scrap iron and such things with a
high fence all ’round. We was talkin’ and
countin’ what was in the pocketbook, when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
gates opened, and there was the plainclothes
men, ready for us.”</p>

<p>Cross-examination brought out the fact
that Alex had never before shared in such an
undertaking. That he had gotten in with
his associates at Sunday ball games, and had
entered upon the plan for a lark. The judge
then began to ask about his home and parents,
but the answers were not willing. Tim
suddenly stumbled his way forward, and before
the astonished court the blind, crippled
boy took his place by the side of Alex. He
felt about until he found Alex.</p>

<p>“And who are you, my little man?” asked
the judge.</p>

<p>“Please, sir, Alex is my brother.”</p>

<p>“And what’s your name?” At this Mr. Rudiger
was compelled to present himself, and
Alex’s identity was made clear. He tried to
lead Tim away, but the judge interposed.</p>

<p>“Please, Judge,” said Tim, “Alex is my
brother. We didn’t know where he was last
night. I’m sure Alex didn’t mean no harm.
He’s my only brother. I knowed they wasn’t
good boys that was with him, ’cause I heard
’em talking with Alex. I’m blind and nobody
asks me to come anyw’ere, but there’s lots of
things to lead a boy where he oughtn’t to go.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
Alex helps me, Judge, ’cause I can’t see.
Please, Judge, let him go this time, and I
know he won’t do it again.”</p>

<p>The queer spectacle of the two lads, one tall
and manly in form but bent with shame, the
other crippled and weak, standing in the presence
of the court hand in hand, drew every
eye. The high, thin voice was heard distinctly
in its plea, for the crowd was silent. The big,
glowing, but sightless eyes were filled with
earnestness, and finally a few tears began to
trickle unheeded down across the weazened
face.</p>

<p>“You’re quite a lawyer, my boy,” said the
judge as he leaned back in his chair and looked
at the two.</p>

<p>“Yes, Tim,” he continued after a moment,
“if Alex will promise to keep out of mischief
I will let him go this time.” There was a
movement of satisfaction in the crowd. Alex’s
two associates scowled, for they did not like it.</p>

<p>“And you are in the saloon business, Mr.
Rudiger?” asked the judge. “The business
you are in makes it impossible for you to
bring up a boy rightly, either in the city or
out of it. You may make an easy living, sir,
but you are putting a fearful handicap upon
your boys. As for this one,” said he, pointing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
to Tim, “God has mercifully sheltered
him from the evil influences of this world, and
in that fact he is fortunate, deformed as he
may be in body and lacking in sight.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said the judge in answer to a
mumbled reply by Mr. Rudiger, “it’s your
business, and I wouldn’t have your responsibility
for all the world. That,” said he, pointing
to Tim, “is the only kind of boy you ought
to have. Case dismissed.” The chair creaked
as the judge turned about and directed his
attention to other affairs.</p>

<p>Nothing could measure the joy of Tim as
he accompanied father and brother home. He
insisted on being first to enter the house,
trembling in his eagerness. But his mother
was too overcome with shame to respond to
the innocent lad. Alex was shamefaced and
silent, and for a week or so scarcely showed
himself on the street. Tim was very happy
in his brother’s company. They rolled and
tossed in their play with the dogs, and Alex
took him riding in a wagon up and down the
sheltered alley.</p>

<p>But as time passed much occurred to trouble
Tim. He had understood only the misfortune
that had come upon his brother. Soon
the unkind taunts upon the street taught him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
what shame meant. The bitter anger and even
tears of Alex and the insults of the street
boys impressed Tim very sadly. When Alex
soon resumed his running about in spite of
his promises, and was impudent to his mother
when she protested, he was painfully perplexed.
Then, too, little by little he came
to see that his father’s business was not respected,
and the fact gave rise to many sad
thoughts in the heart of the little blind boy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER THREE</h2>

<h3><em>Tim Is Hurt</em></h3>
</div>

<p>It was a bright Saturday morning. The
sun shone down from a clear sky, and as its
glowing ball hung mideast, the rays beat with
steady cheer along the gray line of asphalt
pavement. It shone along the steel rails of
the street-car track, worn bright by the constant
passing of the cars. Earlier a gray
mist had made all dim. Have you ever
watched how the coming of the morning light,
as it gradually brightens, changes a morning
mist from the darkness as of clouds to a light,
transparent film, which is almost ghastly?
So on this morning the full light of day had
come, not with one splendid outburst, as when
the sun rises on a clear sky, but gradually,
and it was not until several hours were gone
that one fully realized that it was day.</p>

<p>Now the sun smiled in upon every dingy
shop and store. No less than its cheer upon
a mild winter day was the cheer and bustle of
Christmas trade up and down the avenue. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
the little show-window were crowded all the
toys that little boys and girls love to look at.
Along the walks here and there were to be
seen masses of evergreen, where the grocer
was displaying his stock of trees. But brighter
even than the day, for no snow lay on the
ground and it even seemed warm; brighter
even than the good cheer of the shopkeeper,
who sang out a welcome the minute you
stepped into the door, came out rubbing his
hands, and ready to tell about the wonderful
articles he had to sell; brighter still was the
good cheer of the children at their play. How
happy they were in their Saturday freedom!
How happy too, in their Christmas expectations.
A company of them had gathered at a
certain street crossing on the avenue described
and were shouting and running merrily. It
was tag and safe, shouts, jumps, and running.
They were utterly fearless. And the driver
shouted as they dashed under the very noses
of the horses, and the motor-man scowled because
it was the only thing he had time to do
as they rushed past in front of his car.</p>

<p>This particular day had brought joy to
the heart of little Tim, also. Louise had led
him over to the busy street, and he was now
seated on the horse block in front of a house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
at the crossing mentioned above. Mama had
gone away on one of those mysterious journeys
mamas will make before Christmas.</p>

<p>Alex was among the boys and girls who
were running and shouting about the street,
and Tim’s face shone as he sat, looking intent
but seeing nothing, and yet following keenly
every movement and sound. He smiled to the
passer-by and shouted to the children at play.
Every now and then some one came near and
spoke to him. Miss Merton, his smiling teacher
at the Sunday School, happened to pass by,
and of course patted him on the head and
spoke.</p>

<p>No street-car had passed for some time.
There was some delay up the line. A small
crowd of people had collected who wanted to
go down town. They watched the play as
they waited. Suddenly one of the boys, who
had noticed the waiting people called out:</p>

<p>“There she comes!”</p>

<p>“Must a been some trouble,” said another.</p>

<p>“Aw—you’re a slow one!” shouted a little
fellow, shaking his fist toward the car, which
came hustling down the slope of the long hill,
bounding along as if by jumps, behind time
and in a hurry. Suddenly, just as the car<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
approached the crossing, a wagon drove in
from the cross street.</p>

<p>Clang, clang, clang!</p>

<p>Loud were the cries of warning. Jerk!
Back the horses leaped, almost upon their
haunches, as the driver sought frantically to
avoid a smash-up. Frantically the motor-man
jerked at the brake. Under the sudden
restraint the car jumped the rails, and ran
down along the smooth pavement. There were
wild shouts, shrieks, and groans. Then perfect
silence, as motor-man and conductor
jumped down and ran forward, and the people
in the car hurried off. The car had sped
along until it struck the very horseblock on
which little Tim was seated.</p>

<p>There was a rush of people as the crowd
gathered about the senseless, bleeding figure.
The motor-man and many willing helpers
lifted the car, while the conductor picked up
the injured boy. But he was scarcely able to
find room to lay down the burden. Someone
brought a blanket to put under him on the
cold ground. All were elbowing and pushing
and talking, when a burly policeman pushed
his way in.</p>

<p>“Back, back, please!” were his orders.
“Whose boy is it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>“I know, I know,” were the answers. Some
gave his name, some the name of his father,
and his business, and others told about the
boy. Some volunteered to run for his father.
But while the hurly-burly of talk was going
on, Alex had already run for help, and in a
moment Mr. Rudiger pushed his way into the
crowd.</p>

<p>Many stood in silence and watched as Mr.
Rudiger carried the injured and still unconscious
boy across the street and stepped in at
the door. The policeman helped him, and
soon they were upstairs in the doctor’s office.
The attention of the crowd was then given to
the work of the street-car men as they prepared
to get the car back on the rails, in
which they finally succeeded. There was much
talk and speculation. This work was not yet
done, when Mr. Rudiger came out of the street
door, together with the policeman and the
doctor, and set out for home, carrying Tim in
his arms. The boy had not yet come to.
From all appearances he seemed to be very
seriously hurt. The news went up and down
the street that little Tim Rudiger was killed.
All sorts of rumors went about. And it was
as tho the sunlight had left the street, for all
were saddened by the misfortune of the blind
cripple boy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER FOUR</h2>

<h3><em>Tim’s Christmas</em></h3>
</div>

<p>In the days that followed, the shades were
drawn low in the pleasant cottage home that
had sheltered little Tim all his days. One of
the dogs, which was inclined to be noisy, and
even the parrot, were taken away. On the
sidewalks between the houses, the neighbors
walked on tiptoe. Indeed, all the people round
about felt deeply for the little cripple. On
the avenue people stepped in to ask his papa
about him. And from the windows of houses
neighboring to his home many eyes looked out
to see how long the doctor stopped each day.</p>

<p>At first Tim’s mama had been almost overcome.
She had come home on that sad day
with several packages of presents. Especially
she had had delivered a very pretty cart with
a very good seat, blue box and red wheels,
and plush cushion, a gift for Tim, so that
Louise could take him out riding. And for
some days it stood beside his bed. They did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
not wait for Christmas, but held it up to him
that he might feel of it.</p>

<p>“You must get well, Tim, so that you can
ride in it,” they said. But he answered nothing.
No, Tim would not be able to use it,—no,
not for Christmas at any rate. It was too
bad. Everything was done that money could
provide and that love could imagine in order
to comfort and encourage the little sick cripple.
Tim had always been pale and thin. Now
he was much more so. His eyes glistened at
times, not with animation but with fever-light.
His cheeks were pink too, but it was not a
natural glow. All his pains he bore very patiently.</p>

<p>Already it was getting dark. The lights
twinkled along the streets. In the quiet of the
Sunday afternoon Mrs. Rudiger had sat by
Tim’s bedside. She was almost dozing in the
stillness. Suddenly there was a rap. Three
sturdy little strangers stood at the door, big-eyed,
one of them carrying a bouquet.</p>

<p>“Does Tim what was hurt live here,
ma’am?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes.”</p>

<p>“We bring’d some flowers, ma’am, from the
Sunday school. Tim’s in our class. Yes’m,
teacher sent us.” The little fellows waddled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
in, very dignified, each cap in hand. For
some minutes they stood by the bed. Not a
word was said. Soon they whispered and
beckoned. How it was done no one could tell,
but they understood that they were to leave.</p>

<p>“Please, ma’am, tell Tim we was here. Pale,
ain’t he?” said the biggest, who had carried
the flowers and so felt himself leader and
spokesman. It was interesting to watch the
three little figures as they walked along down
the street. Serious little men!</p>

<p>One day as Tim opened his eyes from a nap
he heard some one speaking softly with his
mother. Over his face there passed a sweet
smile of welcome. It was his teacher. She had
called, and had been talking with his mother
for some time.</p>

<p>“Awful glad to see you.” He tried to smile
and to reach out his hand for her to take.</p>

<p>“Yes, Tim,” said she. After a few words
he began to ask about the Sunday School and
his class.</p>

<p>“Yes, Tim, they were all there except you.
The flowers? Yes, they wanted to send them
to you. Little Henry brought them. He was
always good to you, you know. Bennie and
Oscar were with him. The lesson? Oh, yes.
It was about the three Kings. You know there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
were three wise men, kings, in the East. They
saw a star, and somehow God told them that
they should follow it. They followed it over
deserts and mountains a long way until they
came to Jerusalem. There they went to Herod
and asked: ‘Where is He that should be born
king of the Jews?’”</p>

<p>“A star? Way up in the sky?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed. And when they found out
that Jesus was to be born in Bethlehem, they
set out to go there, and lo, the star went on
before them and brought them right to the
place.</p>

<p>“Yes, Tim, that’s why we put stars on
Christmas trees. Indeed, we’ll have a beautiful
one on the very tip-top of the tree.”</p>

<p>Tim lay thinking long about this story and
about the star after Miss Merton was gone.</p>

<p>One night Tim seemed very feverish and
restless. He tossed about as far as his soreness
and stiffness would allow. He was getting
very sore now from lying in bed so long.</p>

<p>“I’m awful sorry I can’t go to church to
the Christmas tree, Papa,” he said.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad, Tim. You must try to be
quiet and sleep now.”</p>

<p>“Christ was born on Christmas night,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
Tim earnestly. “I was to speak a verse. They
won’t have that verse now, will they?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they’ll find some way,” said his papa.</p>

<p>“The tree will be lovely, teacher said. Popcorn—and
oranges—and things that shine—and
angels—and stars.”</p>

<p>“And see”—he reached out and felt around.
Yes, he found and held up a pretty angel figure.
It was of paper and very light, but too
heavy for Tim. “Angels like this, too.” He
laid it down with a sigh.</p>

<p>“Wish I could be there.” A look of wistful
sorrow passed over his face. He whispered almost
rather than spoke. His papa, sitting by
the bed, had to lean over in order to hear him.</p>

<p>“But Tim, you couldn’t see it anyway.
Why should you be there?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t see?” The lad moved quickly as
he exclaimed, “I ought to hear them. Why
shouldn’t I? Jesus came as a little child. He
loved me. And when He came they put Him
in a stable. And when He grew big, He went
out and preached salvation, and they crucified
Him. He died for me. And when I die, I
shall go to heaven. Cause I ought to be there.
All the little children should. If I was in
church I could show Jesus how I love Him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
He wants me to be glad on Christmas.” Tim
fell back exhausted and was quiet.</p>

<p>The excitement seemed to have been good
for the sick boy, for as he quieted down he
fell asleep. Far into the night they sat by his
bed, for the doctor had told them that Tim
was very sick. Louise and Alex, Mama and
Papa were there. Tim had mourned that he
could not be in church for Christmas and show
Jesus his love and joy. But that night the
doors of a better church and a better home
swung open for him. And with the little thin
paper angel lying by him on the bed, the blind
cripple slept away and went to keep holiday
in heaven above. On that night, I think, he
could see for the first time, and something
better than a Christmas tree at that.</p>

<p>We might tell more of this story; of how
Tim’s class in Sunday School walked by the
coffin for the last time to see his face; of his
sad burial on that cold winter day; of how
sympathetic people said that it was better for
the blind cripple to die than to live. We might
say that his mama learned the way to church;
that Mr. Rudiger became a better man; that
Alex grew up to be a good boy; that Louise
was one of the most faithful girls in that Sunday
School. If we could, we should also be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
able to say that Tim had not lived in vain.
Let us hope so.</p>

<p>And why does God so early take away
from this world to Himself little boys and
girls? Let us see. The farmer takes from the
bin a handful of kernels. “Fine wheat,” says
he, as he blows away part of the grain so as
to take a better look at what is left. It is the
lightest kernels that flee, and as he looks intently
upon the few that yet lie in his palm,
he observes that one is plump and fair and
another shriveled. Yet the shriveled kernel
might happen to yield the finest growth and
bear the amplest fruit. So perhaps it was
with the little blind cripple of No. 316 Blank
Street.</p>

<h2>“<em>Rags</em>”</h2>
</div>

<p>“Rags” was not present. The boys did not
miss him much, to be sure. Mr. Benson, their
good old, gray-haired teacher, had brought the
lad to the Sunday School about six months
before, and until lately he had been present
almost every Sunday. But Bob Jerrold had
found not one friend among the members of
his class.</p>

<p>He had gotten his nickname at the district
school. The first time he came he had been
dressed in queer old clothes, mostly notable
because they were very ragged; and his garments
had remained in the same condition until
the children fixed upon the word “Rags”
as his most appropriate name.</p>

<p>Not all boys begin life with an equally happy
lot. Bob Jerrold was among the unfortunate.
His father was a drunken good-for-naught,
and his mother was a careless slattern
and a boy is very apt to take after his parents.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
Moreover, his parents had long been
despised by all the community as the very
worst and lowest of people, a disgrace to the
neighborhood. Nobody looked for any good
in Bob. So it happened that Bob had to fight
his way amid insult and abuse that his parents
had earned for him.</p>

<p>One day a company of school children came
by the tumble-down old place that the Jerrolds
called home. Catching sight of Bob out
by the barn on a hay-stack, someone threw a
snowball. There was a loud laugh.</p>

<p>“Rags, Rags, Rags!” yelled the whole company.</p>

<p>“Want to fight?” yelled one of the rougher
boys.</p>

<p>“He dassen’t. He might tear his clothes,”
answered another.</p>

<p>Bob dropped his fork and began to dodge
and throw back. He had recognized some of
the members of his Sunday School class among
the company.</p>

<p>At this moment there was a jingle of bells,
and Mr. Benson drove up with his sleigh. The
youngsters all piled in gleefully, and were
soon riding merrily down the road.</p>

<p>When Bob failed to appear in his place in
the class next Sunday morning, and that for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
the second time, his teacher became anxious.
He pitied the boy in his unhappy surroundings.
He had been trying hard to keep the
lad in Sunday School, but he knew how hard
the struggle was for Bob. The good work
now seemed at an end. Bob might be poor
and ragged, and might fight his way in school,
but on Sunday it was different. He could bear
rags and shame and insult. But even he had
some pride, and he refused to sit in a class
together with boys who did not want him.
After much effort, however, Mr. Benson persuaded
him to be present at the Christmas
entertainment and speak the piece that had
been assigned him.</p>

<p>Christmas night came. The church was
packed with happy people. Two beautiful
evergreen trees were the center of attraction.
Between them was an arch, on which were the
words “Peace on earth, good will among men.”
The exercises passed off cheerily, and even
Bob, as he sat beside his teacher, dressed in
a suit that some friend had given him, could
not but catch the spirit of joy and good cheer
that shone from the happy faces of the boys
and girls about him. For every lad and lassie
will agree when we say that there is no happiness
like the glad anticipations of Christmas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>And nothing is so catching, you know, as the
happy heart.</p>

<p>To Bob all this was a dream. Suddenly the
minister, who had gone before the audience,
called his name. At first he shrank back,
frightened; but a smile from Mr. Benson reassured
him, and he stepped upon the platform.
The glitter of the lights dazzled his
eyes, and the stare of the many people made
him tremble. But he raised his head defiantly
and began:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The dead silence that followed as Bob returned
to his seat was followed by a hum of
surprise. Who was that? That Bob Jerrold?
Was it possible? The change in the lad when
properly dressed was itself surprising. But
the full tone and clear voice of the boy, the
deep feeling with which he said each word, all
contributed to draw sympathy about him.</p>

<p>The program was soon over, and the merry
bells were jingling on the starlit Christmas
night as Bob trudged homeward. In his hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
he bore some gifts, too, a thing rather new to
him. Altogether his heart was filled with gladness.</p>

<p>A few days later, James and Charlie, two
lads from the Sunday School class, in passing
by the humble home of the Jerrolds climbed
the fence to see Bob, who was by the stables,
mending a sled. Bob paused as the unexpected
visitors approached, perhaps thinking they
were there to tease him as had been usual.</p>

<p>“Hello, Bob,” called James. “Mending your
sled? Can we help you? How did you break
it?”</p>

<p>Of course, there was something said about
traps and sports and skating and coasting.
Many confidences were exchanged.</p>

<p>As they were to leave, both visitors suddenly
looked uncomfortable, as tho neither
knew what to say. Then James exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh, say, Bob, you haven’t been to Sunday
School for a while.” Bob did not answer.</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Charlie, “the boys thought
you spoke fine at the Christmas festival, and
they’d like to have you come back.”</p>

<p>“’Cause,” said James, “Mr. Benson said
the Christmas message was ‘Good-will among
men,’ and he would like awful well for you to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
come, too. He’s a fine teacher, he is. We all
like him.”</p>

<p>Bob glanced up suddenly. Mr. Benson had
found a tender place in Bob’s heart, too, and
he murmured something to the effect that he
guessed he might come.</p>

<p>Thus Mr. Benson induced the boys to make
up with Bob, and as a result he again entered
the Sunday School. And where he had formerly
met with scorn and abuse he now found
a growing friendship, and you may well believe
that the good-will of his fellows means
much even to the humblest lad. The Christmas
spirit came to that class and to that
school with great blessing, but especially so to
Bob Jerrold. Thus if the Christmas blessing
comes truly home to our hearts, it will mend
many a ragged place, and instead among our
boys we shall find the whole cloth of manly-heartedness
and Christian love.</p>

<h2><em>A Queer Christmas Tree</em></h2>

<p>Again the holiday season had come to the
great and turbulent city. On the streets were
hurrying throngs of shoppers. About the hotels
and public houses cheerful-faced people
came and went in unwonted numbers. Even
the weariness of long and hard days of work
could not wholly drive away the air of gladness
from the busy clerks in the big department
stores and in the little shops. The
butcher, the baker, and the grocer were doing
their best to bring what the good housewife
wanted. The big delivery wagon, overloaded
with packages of all sorts, shapes, sizes and
suggestions, rattled busily from house to
house. And the little boy caught with ecstasy
the sight of a hobby horse’s heel, and the little
girl of the doll’s nose peering warily out
of the paper. How sharp the eyes of little
boys and girls are at Christmas time.</p>

<p>“Is this where Mrs. Asleson lives?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>Thru the narrowly opened door a round,
fat, rather homely face looked out. The man
scowled into the dark. Perhaps he was not
cross, but only trying to make out the figure
in the dim light of the hall. A narrow window
opposite the stairs let in a few struggling,
very feeble rays. It faced blank up a nearby
brick wall. Slowly the eye made out the figure
of a rather young man with a basket on
his arm.</p>

<p>Whether the man scowled or not was settled
by his gruff, “Other door!”</p>

<p>“Thank you, thank you, sir,” answered
Frank cheerily. “You’re done brown as a
turkey with Christmas good nature, sir.” He
spoke none too soon as the door banged shut.</p>

<p>Frank Wilson was employed at a grocery
store some distance down the street. His
brown eyes flashed merrily as he hurried from
customer to customer, from salt to celery,
from potatoes to lemons. The people liked to
trade with him because he was so willing. He
was just delivering a basket at the rear flat
on the fourth floor of a tall tenement. His
breath was still coming by jerks from the
climb as he rapped at the “other door.” After
a moment of perfect stillness the lock rattled,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
the knob turned, and the door opened as
a little boy said:</p>

<p>“Who’s there?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Asleson live here?”</p>

<p>“Ain’t home.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a Christmas basket for her.”</p>

<p>At the magic word Christmas the door
swung back, and a queer scene was revealed
to the surprised gaze of the grocery boy.</p>

<p>“You all belong to Mrs. Asleson?” asked
Frank as he set the basket on the table and
pinched a little youngster. The group drew
back. “Red, black, yellow, brown! Well, well—who’s
the canary?” he continued, as he gave
a whistle and looked around at the blinking
youngsters. “Talk about your Indian chief!”</p>

<p>“I belong down stairs, Mister,” said one of
the little girls.</p>

<p>The group was remarkable. Even aside
from the dirty marks accumulated with a day
of play. The young girl who had spoken was
red-haired. The little tot in kirtles had golden
locks, rather almost white. The other little
girl had dark curls. While the two boys,
brown-haired and blue-eyed, were enough alike
to look like the brothers they were, except
that the larger had an amount of freckles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
such as the younger had not found time to acquire.
The four were the widow’s children.</p>

<p>“Hello!” exclaimed the grocery boy, “what
have you got here?”</p>

<p>“Christmas tree,” said Freckles.</p>

<p>“Of all things!” Frank dropped on a chair.
A Christmas tree! In a small-sized tub set on
the middle of the floor, full of clothes and anything
that might help support, stood a broom,
brush in the air. It was ornamented with
scraps of colored tissue paper, while from the
top stood a bit of candle, burning sweetly and
brightly. The girl with the black curls reached
up and put it out, to save candle, no doubt.
And yet Frank felt in no laughing mood for
the moment. His heart was touched, and
touched deeply.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Maggie, tallest of
the girls, as she pointed to the basket.</p>

<p>“That? Oh, I guess I’m Santa Claus this
time, all right. Is your mama away?”</p>

<p>“She’s workin’,” vouchsafed the boy, number
two for size, and scared at his own boldness,
withdrew behind his sister.</p>

<p>“You don’t say. Where’s your freckles?”
asked Frank as he snatched at the hiding boy.
“Well, never mind, time’ll mend that. You’ll
get them. I thought you were all singing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>“Christmas songs,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Good. Round the tree? Let’s have another.”
And in a moment Frank with the
five children of assorted shades and sizes, and
in that doubtful shade of cleanness children
will sometimes put on, was marching and
dancing around the tree, hand in hand. Before
they knew it they were all together singing
a Christmas song, and shouting with glee,
all forgetful of the basket. Frank, laughing
and out of breath, had just picked up the
smallest child, and they had begun to march
around the room, shouting in chorus, when a
loud sound broke upon their ears.</p>

<p>Bim, bam, boom! How the big cathedral
bell sounds out over the city! Above the noise
and clatter of the street, over the passing
crowd, in and out among the tall buildings
and little cottages that snuggle between, up
and down the alleys and avenues, the mighty
ringing goes forth. Above the very mist and
smoke that bedims the air rises the tall spire
with its heavily buttressed tower. Have you
ever climbed the tall ladders far up into the
belfry? Far down below, the men pull the
ropes, and out from the huge latticed windows
rolls forth the volume of sound. Three bells
there are that chime out upon the fading day.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
So strong are they and vibrant with melody
that the tower trembles. Even the cement
walks and asphalt pavements seem to quiver
under the heavy strokes of the bell.</p>

<p>As Frank opened the window the children
with him crowded about. Over the gravelled
roofs and dusty housetops came the welling
music. It beat about the trembling stones,
rolled in great billows over the house, searched
out every nook and cranny that promised entrance.
About the doors it gathered and quivered
as tho ready to shake them from their
hinges. Who could think that thin glass could
have withstood such onslaught.</p>

<p>Bim-m-m! Ba-m-m! Boom! Christmas bells.
“What a world of happiness their harmony
foretells.” All silent, entranced with the splendid
music of the cathedral chimes, Frank with
the children still stood before the open window.
They had not observed the click of the
door. As they turned about they saw Mrs.
Asleson standing in surprise beside the table.
She was just about to exclaim at the children
for leaving the door unbarred when she paused
in surprise at the basket on the table and the
stranger standing by the window.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, ma’am,” said Frank.
“But I came up here with that basket. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
ordered from the store by the ladies from the
church down the street, and I forgot myself
looking at the children’s Christmas tree. Besides,
ma’am, the chimes are glorious up here
on the fourth floor corner flat. Beg your pardon,
ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Basket for me?” exclaimed the widow in
pleased surprise. Her profuse gratitude was
interrupted by the welcome of the children
and their eager desire to know the contents
of the basket. As he hurried down the stairs
to the work which he had almost forgotten,
Frank felt that it was truly blessed to give.</p>

<p>“If those folks knew how much good they
did with that basket, they’d be happy,” was
his comment.</p>

<p>About the table the little ones crowded as
mother took out the packages of necessities
as well as of Christmas goodies. Their exclamations
of joy were many. Nor least of
all, when a very suitable gift appeared for
each of the little folks, the brown-haired boys,
little tow-head, and sister with the dusky
curls. And each little heart felt that they had
not sung in vain about the broom as a Christmas
tree; but that the Lord Christ had known
to bless the faith of a little child. And a
prayer of fervent thanksgiving arose, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
good mother saw joy shine in the forlorn
home of the widow on that night, all because
a kindly heart had gone forth in sympathy to
her loneliness and her need.</p>

<h2><em>Bigbeard and Little Sander</em></h2>

<p>“Christmas ain’t nothin’ ’out snow!”</p>

<p>Sander was a trifle too scornful in his
tone. Now do not misunderstand him. For
Sander, you see, was a lad eight years of age.
And this was the first time he had seen bare
earth so late in the winter. At least he
thought so. But you will admit that his experience
was limited. Besides, today was his
birthday, and Christmas Eve too. Very poor
birthday it promised to be, for Mama and
Papa were just getting ready to drive off on
a long journey to town.</p>

<p>For you must not imagine that this little
man lives in some fine large house on the avenue
or in some tall flat building in the city!
Early last spring he had slipped off the train
at a most forlorn little station far up in the
frontier. As his eyes looked out that morning
over the bare prairie, broken only by the
rolling hills, with a struggling tree to be seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
here and there, he jumped and frisked. The
sun was just coming up, and the light glistened
on the dewy grass. What little boy
would not have enjoyed the long ride “over
hills, over dale,” until they reached the clump
of trees on a level spot by the river; Antelope
it was called. This name the Indians had very
probably given it long ago. Probably, too,
they had encamped on this very spot; for who
knows when the bubbling spring just below
the hollow had begun to flow, and to draw to
its freshness both man and beast. There was
charm in the very word Indian, to say the
least.</p>

<p>And now the summer was gone. At first
they had lived in a tent. When Sander awoke
in the morning, if it were quiet enough, he
could hear the little birds hopping on the canvas
roof. For a while there was hammering
and building. Then the sod was cut from a
grassy place down by the river, and what
with the earth-wall without and the white-wash
within they had a cozy dwelling. The vegetables
and such crops as they had raised were
gathered. The horses and the two cows were
stabled. The days passed merrily and busily.
There were many new things to see and learn
and try. And already winter was here, Christmas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
Eve, really. And Papa and Mama were
just climbing into the wagon for the long
drive to Somerset, the railway station with its
store or two, some twenty miles away. Mama
cast back an anxious look, for it was risky to
leave a lad eight years old for all day alone
in such a place. But a birthday cake stood
ready on the shelf. And the little fellow whistled
manfully at the confidence being shown
in him. Indeed, he was not afraid. He would
feed and water old Molly, the cow.</p>

<p>About four o’clock in the afternoon Sander
looked up from the slate on which he had been
making pictures. It was very dark. Stepping
to the door he looked out. Why, Mama and
Papa must be on the way home! Cloudy? Yes,
cloudy and beginning to blow. Snow flakes!
Jolly! Snow for Christmas! He shouted for
very glee and danced on the doorstep. But a
great gust almost tumbled him back into the
room. Hurriedly he closed the door. Then he
went out to the stable, but soon returned. As
he lit the lamp, even little Sander, for all his
birthday, realized that a storm was on, and
wondered how Mama and Papa would get
along. And well might he wonder, for the
wind was beginning to roar in the trees and
rattle the door. The snow was thick, and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
became very suddenly dark. A frontier storm
of snow and wind, a blizzard such as Sander
had never seen, such as the oldest had very
seldom seen, was come, and even a little boy
could not help a feeling of dread. Now he
listened at the door, now he looked out at the
window, now he stirred the fire and shivered.
And the moments began to get very long. You
would hardly know in the lad who wipes away
the tear over by the bed the lad who whistled
so manfully in the bright morning.</p>

<p>Some two or three hours later Sander
slipped down from the chair on which he had
been perched for some minutes. What was
that? A noise? Somebody at the window?
Joyfully he ran to the door. The gust that
swept it open blew out the lamp. Somebody
came stamping in.</p>

<p>“Well, not your papa I guess. Got a match,
boy?” said a snowy figure in a muffled voice.</p>

<p>They had shut the door. By the stove gleam
Sander saw two men. After some fumbling
one of them found a match and struck it. In
the light two strangers were seen busily brushing
off the snow. One, big and burly, was rubbing
the ice off his whiskers and blinking under
icy and shaggy eyebrows. In a short time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
the big man and the youth stood warming
themselves.</p>

<p>“Just in time, boy,” said he of the beard,
“just in time. God is good. We were lost for
sure. God only knows what would have happened
if we hadn’t stumbled on this house.
My boy, are you all alone here?”</p>

<p>Sander explained. He was still wondering
at the men. In fact, he stood by the bed a
little scared at the strange folks tumbling this
way out of the night.</p>

<p>“Your parents coming from Somerset tonight?”
At the tone of the big man’s voice
Sander looked up. What was the matter?</p>

<p>Not much later the men were about to sit
down by the table and eat of the lunch found
in their packs. The tea kettle had been singing
cheerfully and the fire was humming.
There was need both of food and heat. Sander
was shivering. He wondered at the men,
for they bent low over their plates and said
something about “thanks and praise.” The
tea had just been poured when there was a
thump at the door followed by several more.
Sander jumped from his chair, exclaiming.
“Mama! Papa!”</p>

<p>While the young man shielded the lamp
Bigbeard opened the door. An exhausted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
woman fell forward into the room, dragging
two children with her.</p>

<p>“Rescue party right here,” cried Bigbeard,
as he banged the door. Soon they were busy
unwrapping the wanderers and setting them
by the fire. It was not Sander’s parents, but
a schoolma’m and two of her pupils. The
smallest boy had his feet partly frozen, and
the girl a hand and a foot. When they looked
up after the snow bathing, rubbing, and warming,
and putting to bed it was almost midnight.
The schoolma’m could speak now. They
had wandered for a long distance.</p>

<p>“Alas, if I had only closed school earlier!”
She sobbed at the thought. “Where are the
other children! But who would have thought?
It was so warm and bright and clear, and then
just after four o’clock such a storm!”</p>

<p>“We cannot be too thankful for our escape,”
said Bigbeard. “The Lord has saved
us from the storm. Perhaps now we had better
eat a bit. But, boy, how about your mama
and papa?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they’re safe enough, I hope.”</p>

<p>Sander did not propose to fall short in
hospitality. He now brought something from
the cupboard. “My birthday cake,” he explained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>“What! On Christmas Eve, too?” exclaimed
the young man.</p>

<p>“And how old are you, Sander?” asked the
schoolma’m. For teachers always want to
know about such matters.</p>

<p>But let us make a long story short. And
it was a very long story to Sander. All that
night the wind roared and howled. Snow
seemed to get in everywhere. The stove
glowed with heat, yet all were shivering.
Every time Bigbeard put in a fresh chunk of
coal he said a word of thanksgiving.</p>

<p>“Good coal never was a bigger blessing
than this night. God care for the man who
brought it here,” was his ejaculation. And
then he would sit down once more. And when
he saw that Sander, the little host, was at last
getting sleepy, too tired to keep awake any
longer, he pulled a Testament out of his
pocket. They all sat about the table, this odd
circle of strangers who had never before met
nor even seen each other, and, as beasts that
flee for safety to some cave or swamp are
friendly in their common danger tho ever so
hostile otherwise, were together, drawn into
fellowship by singular bonds of charity in
this sod hut amid the storm. The young man
Bigbeard called John, and the teacher’s name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
was Miss Stone. Sander, wide-eyed with fear
and wonder, was still sleepily waiting for his
parents. The other children were in bed and
asleep.</p>

<p>Bigbeard opened his Testament and all
bowed their heads devoutly as he read from
the holy pages the lesson so appropriate for
the hour:</p>

<p>“And there were in the same country shepherds
abiding in the fields, keeping watch over
their flocks by night. And lo, the angel of the
Lord came upon them, and the glory of the
Lord shone round about them: and they were
sore afraid. And the angel said unto them,
Fear not; for, behold, I bring you good tidings
of great joy, which shall be to all people.
For unto you is born this day in the city of
David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord.
And this shall be a sign unto you: ye shall
find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes,
lying in a manger. And suddenly there was
with the angel a multitude of the heavenly
host praising God, and saying, Glory to God
in the highest, and on earth peace, good will
toward men. And it came to pass as the
angels were gone away from them into heaven,
the shepherds said one to another, Let us go
even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
is come to pass, which the Lord had made
known to us. And they came with haste, and
found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying
in a manger.”</p>

<p>When he had read these words Bigbeard
closed the book, laid it on the table, and said,
“Let us pray.” And all bent reverently as he
spoke:</p>

<p>“O Lord God, Heavenly Father, Thou
great Shepherd of the sheep, Thou who never
failest Thy people in their need, we thank
Thee that on this night Thou didst send Jesus
Thy Son to earth, that He might live and die
to be our Savior and Helper forever. And we
pray Thee that Thou, who dost temper the
winds to the shorn lamb, wilt this night care
for the lost and wandering who are in the
storm. We thank Thee for this present safety.
Graciously keep Sander’s father and mother
from all harm. Keep us now and forever from
any storm of evil and temptation, and, because
we are the weak children of sin and
death, bring us at last into the sweet safety,
warmth, and joy of heaven, out of this world
of cold and sorrow. As the shepherds went
with gladness to the manger on the first
Christmas Eve, lead our hearts with joy to
Jesus this night. We ask all blessings in His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
name. Amen.” And we might add that Sander
slept very sweetly that night for all his trouble.</p>

<p>Bang! Bang!!</p>

<p>It seems that even Bigbeard had nodded,
as he sat by the fire, tending it from time to
time. Certainly at the noise Sander opened
his eyes out of a dream, sat up and rubbed
them, to become aware of bright daylight.
The noise at the door had awakened all. And
they were on their feet stirring when the lad
crept out of bed. Another thump or two, and
thru the open door in came Sander’s mama
and papa all frost—with the morning cold.
Imagine their surprise and joy to find their
little boy safe, and their sod hut a rescue
home amid the broad prairie. The sun now
beamed as tho he never had set with an angry
frown, and all nature was still with the serene
calm which comes after the terrific storm. The
cold was nipping but the day was cheery. And
as Sander’s mama bustled about for breakfast,
all told their several stories. The night
had been an awful one, and the papers were
later to bring the sad tale of how more than
a hundred school children had perished in the
cold.</p>

<p>And when they had all eaten a good breakfast,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
and Papa and Mama had told how they
had put up at a house on the way to save being
lost, trusting to a higher help for the
keeping of their little Sander, Bigbeard again
read a lesson and prayed, and there were
tears, not of fear but of thanksgiving. For
Bigbeard was not only a good man with
whiskers, black and long, but was a missionary,
who had gone forth to seek the dwellers
on the distant frontier and bring them the
Gospel. Truly he could say with St. Paul “in
perils oft.” We ought probably to give him
something better than a nickname.</p>

<p>You may be sure that the lesson of his
coming did not soon leave that household, nor
did the memory of it leave the heart of the
little boy in the sod hut in the distant valley
of the Antelope. And who can tell to what
higher and better things Sander came when
he grew up, because of the night in the storm.
There was indeed Christmas blessing for him,
besides the present that his parents brought
back from the town in the wagon.</p>

<h2><em>No Christmas</em></h2>

<p>“Why can’t we have Christmas, Mama?”
begged little May, as she pulled her mama’s
dress. Mama was very busy, and of a sudden
she wiped her eyes, for a tear had come.</p>

<p>“Because Uncle Mark is so sick,” she answered,
stooping to kiss the little face turned
up so anxiously. “We cannot be glad and
happy here at home when he is so very ill, can
we, dear?”</p>

<p>“But Mama, can’t we have any tree then,
and won’t there be any Santa Claus?” begged
little May, her eyes almost filling with tears.</p>

<p>“We shall see, my darling,” answered Mama.</p>

<p>You may be sure these things brought no
little trouble to May and her big sister Dorothy,
who boasted eight years, while May only
could claim four. Like all children, they looked
forward with great longing to Christmas,
its presents and its joys, its songs and gladness.
But we must know that all is not happiness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
in this world. There are great sorrows,
and many homes are dark even at Christmas
time. So it was in the otherwise sunny and
cheerful home where May and Dorothy lived.</p>

<p>For alas, only a few days before, their dear
Uncle Mark, always so strong and happy, had
come home to the city very sick. Indeed, he
had gone directly to the hospital. After a
very serious operation, he did not seem to get
much better. The children missed his glad
and cheerful ways, for Uncle Mark was young
and always had been full of fun. To be sure,
he would always greet them with smiles even
now.</p>

<p>It was very sad, indeed. Poor Grandpa and
Grandma had come to be with their dying son,
and every day they went to the hospital to sit
with him. Poor little May could not understand
it all, and when she brought flowers to
her dear uncle, looked with big, round eyes of
wonder to see him so thin and pale.</p>

<p>She went away after talking with Mama
and played a while. Then she came back, with
a question, of course, as usual.</p>

<p>“Isn’t Uncle Mark going to have any
Christmas either, Mama?” she asked.</p>

<p>Mama looked into the earnest face and
said, “Perhaps, darling.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>At that moment she caught a few words of
the song Dorothy was singing in the next
room and said, “Would my little girls like to
sing Uncle Mark a Christmas song?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” they both cried with one
breath.</p>

<p>You may be sure they practiced hard and
willingly to get a good song learned, and came
at once whenever Mama called them.</p>

<p>On Christmas eve it was snowing as our
two little friends came to the hospital door.
They stamped the snow off their feet, shook
themselves, and went in. All was bright and
cheery. Some people think a hospital is a very
gloomy place. But when they came in with
Mama and Papa out of the dark and the snow,
they thought the hospital a very cheerful and
bright place. For you see, the nurses had
made everything bright and beautiful. There
was evergreen, and bells, and mottoes, and it
looked cheerful enough to make even the most
sick well.</p>

<p>You can hardly imagine how happy May
and Dorothy were to find a beautiful Christmas
tree right on the same floor where Uncle
Mark’s room was, and some of the kind nurses
pulled it to his door, that he might raise his
head and take a look. Yes, even he caught<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
the spirit of Christmas joy as he saw the
tinsel, and the candles, the stars, the big
round apples and oranges. Yes, Jesus has a
Christmas blessing for the sick also. Of course
our two little girls did not clap their hands
or shout for glee, for they were in a hospital
where little children must keep very quiet.
But little May had to point out and tell about
the angel figure hung in the tip-top, as tho to
remind of the angels that sang over Bethlehem
to the shepherds.</p>

<p>Poor Uncle! He was very sick and could
hardly raise his head, all bandaged and covered,
but he looked happy and smiled. Then
he wanted May and Dorothy to sing their
Christmas carol. They were just a little bit
afraid at first, because it was in a strange
place, but soon Dorothy picked up courage.
Then May joined in with her little song. For
they were glad to do something for poor Uncle
Mark, you know. These were the verses
they sang:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>
<p>Of course, Uncle Mark thanked them very
much for the song, yes, even with tears in his
eyes. When they went away, he raised his
head and waved a good-bye with his hand, and
smiled. But when they were gone, the tears
ran down his cheeks, for he never saw them
again, and they never sang another song to
their dear uncle.</p>

<p>The next day, after Christmas day, a very
sad company gathered in the home of our two
little friends. Uncle Mark was gone, never to
return; and when it was all over, they talked
together of their sorrow.</p>

<p>“Uncle Mark had a Christmas anyway,
didn’t he?” said little May, who could not
understand.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, child,” said Mama.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t that a beautiful tree!” exclaimed
Dorothy; but she should have known better
than to speak. For Uncle Mark had a Christmas
indeed, with Jesus in heaven, where there
is no hospital, or sickness, or sorrow, but only
joy and praise for evermore. And I am sure
both little girls, when they came to understand,
were glad that they sang him a Christmas
song, even if they had no tree and no
Christmas at home.</p>

<h2><em>Buddy’s Christmas Tree</em></h2>

<p>“Whyfor no snow, Unc’e Don?”</p>

<p>Uncle John went right ahead at his walk
and said nothing.</p>

<p>“Whyfor no snow, Unc’e Don? Kismas come
soon.”</p>

<p>Buddy seemed to have the idea fixed in his
head that there ought to be snow at Christmas
time. He had been sucking his thumb industriously
for some time, and finally broke
out in the above remark.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Uncle John, “If Christmas
comes soon, I shouldn’t be surprised if we did
get some snow. Why does Buddy want snow?”</p>

<p>“So dat Santa Claus can make his sleigh
go.”</p>

<p>The two had been walking back and forth
for quite a while in the morning sunshine
along the path to the garden gate. As a
variation they had sat upon the bench under
the wide spreading pine tree that stood near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
the corner of the house, its long branches
reaching almost to the porch. Of late the
days had been almost summer-like, and old
gray-headed Uncle John enjoyed the change
of being out in the fresh air. Thus their
companionship had grown from day to day.</p>

<p>The path from the porch and front door
of the house was well beaten. It led right out
to the gate. On either side were bushes, bare
of leaves and dry with the winter season, as
well as the withered stems of flowers. Along
the fence that lined the road was a row of
locust trees, from which practically every
leaf was gone. This meant a good deal when
one remembers how small the leaves of the
locust are.</p>

<p>“Look—look, Unc’e Don!”</p>

<p>“Well, Buddy, you know I can’t look,” was
the answer.</p>

<p>“No look, Unc’e Don?”—Buddy seemed
very much surprised. He looked up at the
tall figure beside him with a puzzled air.</p>

<p>“Whyfor, Unc’e Don, whyfor no look?”</p>

<p>“Well, Buddy, you know my eyes don’t see.
I used to see pretty well—few better, I should
say—many is the squirrel I have hit right in
the fall—but I’m getting old, and some time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
ago, before Buddy came, my eyes quit seeing.”</p>

<p>“Eye quit?”</p>

<p>Buddy looked up with sympathetic interest
at the tall form of Uncle John, tall even if
bent with age, and square shouldered still.
As we said above they had come to be companions,
now since Buddy had made his home
at the old home of his mother, the good farm
place now owned and run by two of his uncles,
Will and Martin. As they walked about the
little fellow had never realized that he had
been eyes to the old man, and that his busy
chatter told of what was passing about. The
little lad had been both eyes and ears as he
talked. Everything attracted his attention
from the bird on the branch to the passing
automobile, from the sunshine glittering
among the branches of the trees to the whistle
of the winds across the fields.</p>

<p>The farm home stood at the cross-roads
and had been the only home of which Buddy
had any remembrance. Here his mama had
been a little girl, and here his “grannyfather”
had lived his days. Grandfather had planted
the pine tree, which now rose way above the
house top.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>“Mail-man, mail-man!” Buddy was shouting.</p>

<p>“Me get ’em, me get ’em!” he added, running
for the gate. Mr. Mail-man handed a
piece or two to Buddy, but waited for Uncle
John before he handed over the rest.</p>

<p>“Some advertising” he explained, “Buddy
will give it to Uncle Martin.”</p>

<p>Buddy started for the house, very proud of
the commission that had been entrusted to
him. He was met at the door, and by the
arrival of Old John everybody became busy
about the mail. Buddy and Uncle John soon
found themselves on the bench once more under
the tall pine.</p>

<p>“Letter my Daddy?”</p>

<p>Buddy had been quiet again for some time,
and then broke out in this remark.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess not—what made you think
of that?”</p>

<p>Uncle John had been unable to suppress his
surprise. Instinctively he reached out to lay
his hand upon the boy.</p>

<p>“I dno.” Buddy fell into a meditative sucking
of his thumb once more. The question of
his daddy had been one never referred to in
the house. He had gone away with the soldiers
when the Great War broke out. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
was before Buddy was born. For some time
they had received letters, but now for more
than three years there had been no word. In
secret Mama had likely shed many tears. As
far as Buddy was concerned, it never seemed
to make any difference. He had never known
a father, and had lived a happy child and
taken all good things for granted. Like the
sparrows of the field, he had lived without a
care. The thought of a father had hardly
come into his life. For this reason the words
were all the more a surprise, and old, gray-headed
Uncle John sat struck silent in wonder
at the boy.</p>

<p>“Me got letter, too, Unc’e Don,” explained
Buddy, and his old Uncle laughed.</p>

<p>“Who wrote the letter, Buddy?” inquired
Uncle.</p>

<p>“Aw—jes’ one o’ dem bill ones,” explained
Buddy.</p>

<p>And Uncle John laughed again.</p>

<p>“Aw’fu’ big tree, Unc’e Don,” remarked
Buddy, all of a sudden, changing the subject.</p>

<p>“I suppose it has grown big,” answered
Uncle; “I remember when your grandfather
planted that tree. It wasn’t so big then.”</p>

<p>“Grannyfader, he plant it?” Buddy showed
a surprised interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, long ago. It must have grown big
since then. Most of the trees he planted have
died I suppose.”</p>

<p>The pine tree was indeed a large one.
Standing as it did away from the corner of
the house, it rose a straight pine trunk, its
green top reaching far above the roof of the
house. The tree looked like a pyramid or
cone, had in fact grown more and more into
the shape of a cone. The branches reached out
in a remarkably straight way, the lower ones
being of extraordinary length. The green
spines with an occasional cone contrasted with
the brown and rough bark. It was indeed a
noble tree, and had grown nobly in its place
since the day “Grannyfader” set out the original
little pine shoot.</p>

<p>“Santy Claus—he come—come way up in
air,” explained Buddy.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe—if there is a Santa Claus—”
answered Uncle John.</p>

<p>“Santy he come way up in air—come right
down tree—he do,” explained Buddy.</p>

<p>“Travels in an airship?—a Santa for boys
and girls to talk about, I suppose,” continued
Uncle.</p>

<p>“Climb right down tree—huh?” added Buddy
questioningly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>“Probably that would be a handy way, all
right,” agreed Uncle, smiling and bobbing his
head. For a long time Buddy sat studying the
tree and the new idea that had gotten into his
mind. About this time Mama’s voice called
from the doorway and told them that dinner
was ready. When dinner was over Buddy was
to take his usual nap.</p>

<p>“No want sleep,” was his remark as he
rubbed his eyes. Mama went on rocking just
as tho he had not spoken.</p>

<p>“Haint Buddy got no daddy?”</p>

<p>The big, round eye looked up sleepily and
earnestly.</p>

<p>Mama did not answer, but she clasped her
little boy tightly in her arms. Soon the sandman
began to trip around, at first on tip toe,
ever so quietly, and as Mama rocked and
hummed Buddy little by little found his eyes
so heavy they would not keep open.</p>

<p>“Buddy’s papa indeed!” This was what
Mama thought of, as she laid the little boy
down on his cot for a nap. Her eyes filled
with tears as she watched the quiet breathing
of the little lad, now far away in the still
places of dreamland.</p>

<p>Papa indeed! Sooner or later the question
must come from Buddy’s lips, and the longing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
of the little heart speak from the big, inquiring
eyes. Buddy had never seen his daddy.
Perhaps there had been unkind words and misunderstandings.
The letters had come back
from the Great War, and they were kind
enough. But then they had ceased, and the
heart was torn between the question whether
Daddy had forgotten or whether something
had happened to him, of which there was no
report. Once or twice, to begin with, there
had been a gift, but now there had been no
word or message for a very long time. Mama
sighed as she turned from the quiet little cot.</p>

<p>During these years Buddy had been a great
comfort to Mama in her loneliness. Now he
was approaching his fourth birthday. He was
old enough to catch the Christmas idea. Certainly
it had taken full possession of him.
Mama had read and told the Christmas story
of the Savior. Night and day he had dwelt
upon its prospects. At the most unexpected
moments and in the most unexpected ways he
would break out with the notion of what was
coming. He was all the time referring to the
“Kismas Tree” and the “Kismas Time.” And
now, as old, gray-headed, blind Uncle John
related, he had connected the Christmas idea
with the idea of Daddy. Singular what expectations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
may arise in the mind of a little
boy. Mama stood, the tears rolling down her
face, and watched the tousled head, the long,
slender limbs, the high open brow, as Buddy
lay in his little bed.</p>

<p>The following days were busy with holiday
preparations. Buddy ran about in play, but
came back every now and then to talk about
his expectations, and to get a cooky or a
piece of bread and butter. Uncle John entertained
him and occupied his attention, so that
Mama might be able to assist Aunt Clara and
the folks about the house in their work. Uncle
Martin and Uncle Will always had a word for
Buddy. They brought in the wood, saw to the
fires, and went out to do the chores. Sometimes
Buddy went along, and always he had
many things to say. The only thing was that
he kept everybody busy watching him if he
happened to be along.</p>

<p>“Me nervy,” he explained, and in saying
so he was only echoing Uncle Will, who sometimes
got out of patience with his antics.
Uncle Martin had most patience, in listening
to his many little speeches and answering his
questions. Buddy inquired many times about
the hanging up of stockings and other matters
that seemed to him very essential in view of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
the coming event. On Christmas Eve he hung
up his stocking, and while the family sat
about, some reading papers, others busy with
final preparations, he allowed Mama to rock
him to sleep, while “Unc’e Don” dozed in his
big chair. The evening had foretokened a
storm. Uncle Will had even intimated that
there were prospects of snow. Outside the
wind roared, at times it even howled. The
night was a dark and cloudy one. The comfort
of a warm fire in a sheltered home was
good indeed, as they sat about on the blustering
and stormy evening of the night before
Christmas.</p>

<p>The next morning was clear and bright. All
had been very quiet, about the house. Uncle
Will had looked to the fire and had been to
the barn about his chores. And now, as he
stamped his feet on the porch, he entered with
a loud</p>

<p>“Merry Christmas!”</p>

<p>Buddy found himself crawling out of bed
with wide open eyes in response to the sound
of the voices calling in answer to Uncle Will.</p>

<p>“Mama, Mama,” he yelled, and Mama came
at once on hearing that he was awake.</p>

<p>“Mama!—See—See—Snow—lot o’ snow!”</p>

<p>“Why—sure enough, Buddy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>“Kismas time, Mama!”</p>

<p>Before his mother was able to answer,
Buddy had run out of the bedroom and was
on the way down stairs. It was not until he
had reached the foot of the lowest step that
Mama caught up with him, and he would likely
have run right out doors into the cold and
snow had he not been stopped. Aunt Clara
called from the kitchen to remind him of the
stockings he had hung up. In she came also.
Uncle John was already seated in his big
chair, and Uncles Martin and Will were warming
themselves. With a shout Buddy hurried
up and was soon very busy digging out of
his stockings the many presents that were
there, bags of candy, toys, nuts. He was so
busy, as were they all, that they almost forgot
their breakfast. When Aunt Clara reminded
them that breakfast was ready, Buddy
could only be persuaded to come to the table
when he was allowed to take with him a roly-poly
policeman of celluloid and an iron horse
that he had found among his presents. They
had all bowed their heads quietly, while Uncle
Will read the Christmas story from the Gospel
of St. Luke, and had bowed their heads in
prayer.</p>

<p>The last words of the Lord’s Prayer were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
just being uttered, with the “Amen,” when
there was the sound of a rap at the door. All
about the table started with surprise. Uncle
Martin arose to open the door. When the
door swung back there stood before them a
tall figure dressed in a heavy gray overcoat.</p>

<p>The sudden silence of a deep surprise fell
upon them all. Uncle Martin seemed at a loss.
It was a very unusual time to get a visitor.
The stranger took off his cap. He said:</p>

<p>“Mary?” Why he put the word in the tone
of a question seemed hard to understand.
Then suddenly Mama gave a scream, and rose
from her chair. The stranger came forward,
and took her in his arms. Horse in one hand
and policeman in the other, Buddy looked up
wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, Buddy! Oh, Charles!”</p>

<p>These were the words with which Mama
greeted Daddy. For it was no other than
Daddy, returned from the World War.</p>

<p>The Christmas breakfast was indeed a happy
one. Daddy told of his long and delayed
stay with the Army of Occupation, of his prolonged
and deadly illness, in which he had
twice been given up for dead, and of how he
had at last found himself able to set out for
home. Thus there was a busy hour of talk, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
which Uncle Martin and Uncle Will forgot
their chores, as they sat about the table and
conversed. Buddy was safely located between
his mama and papa, altho he looked with
somewhat shy wonder at the latter, whom he
could not be said to know, as he had never
seen him before.</p>

<p>The men went about their work, and this
reminded Buddy of his presents. Quickly he
wriggled down to the floor and ran to where
his stockings had hung.</p>

<p>“Well, well!” exclaimed Daddy, “somebody
has been buying Buddy presents, all right. Too
bad Papa did not bring Buddy something too.”</p>

<p>All of a sudden Buddy started for the door.
He jerked and twisted the knob.</p>

<p>“Why, Buddy,” exclaimed his Mama, “it’s
cold outside—lots of snow—you can’t go outside
now.”</p>

<p>“Kismas Tree! Kismas Tree!” exclaimed
Buddy.</p>

<p>“Cold out there, all right, as I can tell,”
explained Papa. “Thought I would have
frozen as we drove down this morning.”</p>

<p>By this time Buddy was out in the snow on
the porch, dressed as he was in his nighty.
He did not mind the snow.</p>

<p>“What do I see?” exclaimed Mama. “Stockings—stockings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
hanging from the big pine.’</p>

<p>“Well, I never,” was all that Aunt Clara
could say. She had now crowded close behind
them. Papa went out into the snow, and soon
came back with a pair of stockings of Buddy’s
which he found waving in the wind.</p>

<p>“So you hung your stockings on the Christmas
Tree?” said Papa to Buddy as they sat
down by the fire to warm.</p>

<p>“That boy must have hung those up yesterday
afternoon,” exclaimed Aunt Clara.</p>

<p>“I declare,” said Mama, “I was looking exactly
for those stockings last night. They
were the ones we were going to put up for
Buddy, but we could not find them.”</p>

<p>Buddy sucked his thumb in silence.</p>

<p>“Santy Claus, he come—come on the big
Kismas Tree,” explained Buddy. “Brung me
candy and nuts and horrsie-n-n-n-”</p>

<p>“Yes,” explained Uncle John, “he was talking
yesterday about that tree. I told him
Santa might come in an airplane. Buddy
seemed sure he would come and would crawl
down by that big pine. Guess somebody did
come, too—even just like they come by airplane,”
added Uncle John.</p>

<p>Mama put her hand on Daddy’s shoulder.
Buddy only looked wise.</p>

<h2><em>Three Pines</em></h2>

<p>Ginkle had found his way once more out
upon the front veranda. Ginkle, you understand,
was the name of a tousle headed boy
just out of bed. The morning sun shone
brightly across the lake. The air was still
fresh with the early dew. Grandfather sat on
the lower step, smoking his after-breakfast
pipe. The early day was so clear and still,
and the lake so quiet under the hills, covered
with pine forest and second growth, brush and
grass, that the pipe he smoked might well have
been called the pipe of peace. This did not
mean that there were any Indians about.
Ginkle came down the steps and found his
way out to the tall trees which crowned the
curved edge of the hill, just as it began to
slope gently toward the water’s edge. The
bank itself was rather sharp and high, so that
the little boy climbed down a series of steps,
and so reached the shore, and went upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
dock or boat-landing to sit down and look
about him. It is hard telling what a little boy
of five will think about when he first gets out
of bed in the morning, and begins the new day.</p>

<p>“Ginkle! Where’s Ginkle!” This is what
they had come to call him. His right name
was Sylvester.</p>

<p>“Ginkle—come to breakfast.”</p>

<p>Granny was calling, and soon our little
friend made his way up hill again, and was
busy with his morning meal.</p>

<p>“Granny goin’ ’way?” was his question, as
he looked up from his oatmeal. He had happened
to notice that Grandma was busy about
preparations.</p>

<p>“Yes, Ginkle. Granny’s going away for the
day with some friends,” was the answer.</p>

<p>Grandfather’s summer home was a pleasant
place for Ginkle to visit. A five-year-old boy
always likes his grandfather and grandmother.
This was now the second summer that he was
spending at Three Pines. The cottage took its
name from the three splendid big pine trees
that stood right in front of the house, crowning
the hill. The shore line below formed a
semi-circle, against the foot of which the
bright waves of the lake beat in the early sunshine.
The sand was not so thick as to prevent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
a fresh growth of grass over the hill-top
and about the house. The lake was somewhat
over a half mile wide at this place. The
launches sped back and forth on their errands
up and down the lake. On the other side,
under the shadow of the pine woods that lined
the shore, could be seen the boats of the early
fishermen.</p>

<p>Our little boy had hardly waked up yet,
in spite of his breakfast, to judge from the
quiet way in which he stood under the three
pines, sucking his thumb. He was tall and
slim for a boy of his age. A big head rose
above his shoulders, covered with a shock of
light brown hair. He was about to toddle forward
once more toward the steps that led
down to the water, when there was a call—</p>

<p>“Hey—little boy—Ginkle!”</p>

<p>This time it was Grandfather who called.</p>

<p>“Come on, Ginkle—Granny’s leaving now.”</p>

<p>On the chair by the table was Granny’s bag,
all ready, and soon they were following her
along the path to the rear fence, where a car
stood waiting. Mrs. Joyce was going out for
a ride, apparently, and Granny was to go
with her.</p>

<p>“Ginkle wants a ride?”</p>

<p>Certainly he did. It was unnecessary for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
Mrs. Joyce to ask. But as Granny climbed in,
Grannyfather took him from the running
board of the car, and held him in his arms,
while he watched the car disappear down the
road among the trees and bushes.</p>

<p>“Now Ginkle, you must be a good boy;
Granny is going away all day, and you must
take good care of Grannyfather.” This had
been the good-bye message.</p>

<p>“Aw wight.” Ginkle was willing, even if
disappointed about the ride.</p>

<p>“Grannyfather will see that you get lots
to eat.”</p>

<p>“Granny bring me something?”</p>

<p>“Oh, maybe.”</p>

<p>Grandfather and Ginkle then walked together
along the path back to the house.</p>

<p>“Now Ginkle,” said Grandfather, “I guess
we’ll take a trip too. What do you say?”</p>

<p>“Aw wight.” Ginkle was agreeable.</p>

<p>For some time they were busy about the
house. On the table they found a big basket.
Grandfather lifted the cover just enough to
see that it was filled with good things to eat.
Then he hunted up his ax, sharpened it, and
put on some working clothes. He and Ginkle
set out, carrying the basket between them.
Along the sandy brush-lined road they went,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
Grandfather carrying his ax upon his shoulder.
After something more than a half-mile
walk they found themselves at a particularly
wild and wooded part of the shoreline. In
among the pines were gray rocks at intervals,
and Grandfather hunted up a fresh bubbling
water spring.</p>

<p>“Now, Ginkle, we must get to work,” said
Grandfather.</p>

<p>“What do?” inquired the lad.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll just cut down a tree or two,”
was the answer.</p>

<p>Soon a tree was selected, and to work went
the ax. The woods fairly rang with the blows,
the chips flew so that Ginkle had to dodge
them, and very shortly two tall pines had
fallen to the ground with a crash. The little
boy ran away at first as if scared. However,
he soon learned that there was no danger, and
began to climb over the logs and run about,
shouting till the woods rang.</p>

<p>“Grannyfader cut nudder tree?”</p>

<p>“Provided Ginkle will lend a hand,” said
Grandfather, as he looked about. “Which one
shall we take?”</p>

<p>“Dis one,” said Ginkle, petting the bark of
a big tree.</p>

<p>“Not a bad choice,” answered the other,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
measuring the tree with his eye. In a moment
Grandfather was in position and hard at
work. Ginkle in the meantime ran about on
the dry bedding of spines that covered the
ground, ran in and out among the bushes,
climbed upon the fallen logs of the trees that
had been cut, and ran back and forth on their
stems.</p>

<p>“Oh, boy,” exclaimed Grandfather, wiping
the sweat from his brow, “I think we’ll eat
our lunch.”</p>

<p>“Aw wight,” exclaimed Ginkle, who had
been so busy as to forget to be hungry. They
hunted up a shady place, not far from the
spring, and Grandfather opened the basket.
Sandwich after sandwich disappeared, and
both ate and drank heartily.</p>

<p>“Cold, isn’t it?” said Grandfather as he
held the cup fresh from the spring to the lad’s
lips. “Yes—cool and refreshing. And now
we’ll be ready for work again.”</p>

<p>“Yep,” said Ginkle; “Grannyfader, what
makes the water bubble that-a-way?” Ginkle
was pointing at the spring.</p>

<p>“Oh,” explained the other, “The water’s
trying to talk, and bubbles are the best it can
do.” Setting to work at the tree, his ax rang
for some time very vigorously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>“That pine’s big,” exclaimed he, as he
stopped to wipe the sweat from his face.</p>

<p>“Uh-huh,” agreed Ginkle.</p>

<p>This time Grandfather went to work in
earnest, cutting away some brush in order to
make room. He chopped away more vigorously
than ever, and for a time he forgot his
little grandson altogether. Suddenly he remembered.</p>

<p>“Ginkle, oh Ginkle, where are you? Keep
away—look out!” he called. He had cut at
the tree from both sides and had gone deeper
than he thought. Suddenly the big pine began
to totter. Glancing about for fear the boy
might be caught, he cried out in warning.
Ginkle was at a safe distance, but Grandfather
forgot himself. As he turned he found the
tree falling fast in his direction, and as he
sought to jump away, his foot caught in some
brush and he fell headlong, the tree across
his prostrate body. Swish went the branches
among the brush. Face down lay Grandfather,
groaning under the fall and the heavy pressure
of the fallen trunk. The cry that Ginkle
gave was a relief, even in spite of his own
danger, and the little fellow came to Grandfather’s
side and tugged at his arm, crying
big tears of fear and grief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>“Grannyfader hurted? Grannyfader hurted?”
sobbed the lad.</p>

<p>“Help—we’ll need help,” groaned the prostrate
man, “I—I’ll never get out of this without
help.”</p>

<p>“What do, Grannyfader, what do?” exclaimed
Ginkle, still tugging at his sleeve.</p>

<p>“Might run and tell Granny,” groaned
Grandfather.</p>

<p>No sooner said than to his astonishment the
little fellow disappeared, running down the
path toward the road. For some time thereafter
Grandfather lay struggling with his
groans and his pain. It hardly seemed possible
that Ginkle could bring help, and Grandma
was far away, as he remembered, alas.</p>

<p>The birds chirped cheerfully, and the insects
hummed. The wind sounded among the
pines. From the lake he could hear the distant
sound of the passing launch. Otherwise
the only sound was his own groaning.</p>

<p>What had become of Ginkle? He had set
out at a full run, and a short time later appeared
at the gate to the cottage, and rushing
up the path and the steps, threw the door
wide open yelling—</p>

<p>“Granny—Granny!”</p>

<p>There was no answer. Grandmother was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
not yet at home. Crying loudly, and still calling
for “Granny,” the lad ran down the path
to the road, as tho not knowing what to do
next. There he stood crying by the open gate,
both his fists in his eyes. He stopped suddenly
at an unexpected sound.</p>

<p>“Hi there, little boy, what’s the matter?”</p>

<p>In his crying he had not noticed that a car
had stopped in which sat two men.</p>

<p>“That’s right, little boy, quit your crying,”
shouted one of them.</p>

<p>Ginkle stared a moment, then he yelled—</p>

<p>“You lie, I don’t quit. I just stop a little
while and then I begin again.” Ginkle once
more set up a loud bawling.</p>

<p>“Well, boy, what’s the matter? Can’t you
stop long enough to tell us?” asked one of the
men as he climbed down and started for the
gate.</p>

<p>“Guess he’s purty near too young to explain,”
remarked the chauffeur.</p>

<p>“My grannyfader, he hurted. He tumble
on de tree,” sobbed Ginkle. The moment he
saw the man coming toward him he set out at
a run, “Grannyfader, he here,” continued the
lad, as he ran and sobbed.</p>

<p>“Believe me, that kid c’n run,” exclaimed
the stranger, as he climbed back into the machine.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
The Ford started, rattled its usual
way, and in a moment they were following the
boy up the sandy road. When they caught up,
one of the men jumped out and ran to catch
the hurrying lad, and for the rest of the way
he followed him, for the little chap jumped
about and refused to be picked up. On ahead
they hurried, and the car followed behind them
until they reached the place where Ginkle insisted
on going into the woods.</p>

<p>“Grannyfader, he here,” he explained. There
was nothing to do but to follow the little
guide. The stranger had not yet been able
to get an idea as to what might be the matter.
His companion stopped the machine and came
hurrying after into the bushes.</p>

<p>“Oho!” exclaimed the man leading Ginkle,
“so this is what’s the matter. Believe me,
friend, you’re in bad.”</p>

<p>“So he got help, did he?” groaned Grandfather,
as he twisted his head to look.</p>

<p>“The little feller sure raised some holler,”
assured the man, as he bent down, touched
Grandfather on the head, and felt of his hand.</p>

<p>“Say,” said the companion, who had also
now come up, and was bending to look, “It’s
lucky, all right, there seems to be a kind o’
hollow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>The two found themselves unable to move
the heavy tree, and so the one hurried back
to the car for a shovel, and the other began
to cut away more brush. For a time they
looked around for something with which to
pry, but they were not successful.</p>

<p>“You block it up, and I’ll begin diggin’,”
said the man who had been with Ginkle. Ginkle
now sat beside Grandfather, talking to him.
Gently one of the men picked him up and put
him in a safe place so that they could work,
explaining to the little fellow what they were
about to do. He himself hurried to find pieces
of log which he could put under the tree for
safety, while the other dug away with the
shovel. They exchanged work, and so kept
at it actively for some minutes.</p>

<p>“Say, friend, do you think you can stand
some pulling?” asked one.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess. Just try me,” answered
Grandfather. Ginkle cried loudly again, but
they were too busy to notice. In a few moments
Grandfather sat against a tree, recovering
from his terrible experience.</p>

<p>“Grannyfader tick? Grannyfader hurted?”
Ginkle’s cheeks were still wet with tears as
he spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>“Not so bad, I guess,” answered Grandfather,
“not so bad as it looked, I hope.”</p>

<p>“Awkward place to turn, looks to me,” remarked
the chauffeur as he set out thru the
brush toward the road. Soon they heard the
machine purring, and in a few moments he reappeared.
Both men now took Grandfather
by the arms, and with their help he was able
to make his way with some groaning out to
the car.</p>

<p>“Granny—Granny, she not home, maybe,”
said Ginkle, climbing close to Grandfather in
the rear seat.</p>

<p>“Oh—my back—feels like it’s broken,”
groaned Grandfather, as he clung to the cushions.
Soon the car started. The men drove
very slowly and carefully on their way back
to the house. From the machine they helped
the injured man carefully on his way into
the house, and had just placed him among
pillows in a big, comfortable-looking rocker,
when Ginkle ran suddenly for the door.</p>

<p>“Granny—here Granny coming,” he
shouted.</p>

<p>In a twinkling he was down the hill at the
water’s edge. She had returned by the afternoon
boat. He met Grandmother on the landing,

had happened to “Grannyfader” that Granny
was thoroly scared, and absolutely confused as
to whether it had been a tornado or a band
of robbers, between Ginkle’s description of
fallen trees and strangers suddenly appearing,
so that she hurried breathless up the steps,
across the porch, into the house, Ginkle pulling
vigorously at her hand all the way and
hurrying her on.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter? What do you
mean? Grannyfather hurt? How can that
be?” exclaimed Granny, all out of breath, as
she jostled into the room along with the lad.</p>

<p>“Why—what has happened?” was her anxious
question, as she hurried to the rocker.</p>

<p>“Not so bad, Granny. Don’t get scared,”
was the reassuring word from Grandfather.
All the rest were silent, and the little grandson
stood by with open eyes, chewing his
thumb, as the injured man went on to explain
what had happened. By this time Granny
was straightening the pillows, and bustling
about to help him into a more comfortable
position.</p>

<p>“Mighty lucky the little feller was around,”
remarked the chauffeur, “believe me, he c’n
run. We had a hard time to keep up with
’im.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” added Grandfather, “you ought to
have seen him start off for help. He disappeared
like a shot, without even stopping for
me to instruct him,” said Grandfather, stroking
the bushy head as he spoke.</p>

<p>Grandmother was profuse in her gratitude
to the men as they left, and went immediately
on their departure to telephone for a doctor.
On his arrival he made a careful examination,
and assured them that no bones were broken,
that aside from bruises and a severe wrenching
of the back-bone there was likely no injury.
After a few days, if Grandfather was
careful, he would quite surely be about again
as usual. The escape certainly was a fortunate
one, and the service rendered by our
little friend remarkable. The doctor patted
Ginkle on the head and left.</p>

<p>While the doctor came again the following
day, and then again later, all went as he had
at first judged. After a few days Grannyfather
and grandson were again seated in the
warm morning sunshine out under the pines.</p>

<p>“Grannyfader feel well?” inquired Ginkle
looking out toward the fresh blue water of
the lake.</p>

<p>“Remarkably so, boy, remarkably,” was the
answer; “shall we go tree cutting again?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>“Grannyfader want to go?”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe, how about Ginkle?”</p>

<p>“Um.”</p>

<p>“Big tree here,” exclaimed the lad, pointing
at the three tall pines just in front of the
bench on which they were seated. “Jus’ like
big Kismas Tree.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed. They would make great
Christmas trees, wouldn’t they? Does Ginkle
remember the Christmas story?”</p>

<p>“Tree wise men, too,” remarked he—“tree,
jes’ like big trees here, aint they.”</p>

<p>“In number, yes. I suppose you’re right
there,” answered Grandfather. “What’s that
got to do with our pines? What do you mean,
Ginkle?”</p>

<p>“Um—I dno.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, you remember, don’t you
Ginkle.”</p>

<p>The lad looked out across the lake and apparently
began to think about something else.
